Use this command to view the talairach structurals as the base for sliceview.


sliceview-sess \
   -space tal \
   -subject talairach \
   -base bshortAB \
   -contrast CNAME -analysis ANAME \
   -map MAPNAME \
   -isxavg ISXAVGMETHOD \
   -df sessdirfile -sf sessid \
   -slice SLICESPEC

There are 3 critical options:
  -space tal -- must be in talairach space
  -subject talairach -- can only be used with talairach as subject
  -base bshortAB - A is the resampling resolution (ie, the value
                   passed to func2tal-sess with the -res flag).
                   B is the in-plane display resolution, which must 
                   be less than or equal to A.

In $SUBJECTS_DIR/talairach/mri/T1, there are the following 8
directories:

bshort21
bshort22
bshort41
bshort42
bshort44
bshort82
bshort84
bshort88

These were resampled from the T1 volume.
