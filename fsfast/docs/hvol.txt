What is in the h volume created by selxavg-sess?

selxavg-sess creates a directory called bold/analysis in which several
volumes will be stored. One of these is the "h volume", ie,
h_000.bfloat, h_001.bfloat, ..., corresponding h_000.hdr. There are
also single h.bhdr and h.dat files.

The h volume will have many frames, and the interpretation of
these time points is quite obscure and hard to understand. But that is
the purpose of this document.

The number of frames will be equal to:
  Nframes = 2*(Nc+1)*Na

Nc is the number of conditions (argument to -nconditions in mkanalysis-sess).

Na is the number of regressors per condition. This number can change
depending upon how you are doing the analysis. 

For an FIR model (ie, not using the -gammafit or -spmhrf flags), then
Na = TimeWindow/TER, where TimeWindow is the argument of the
-timewindow flag. TER is the argument of the -TER flag. If you have
not specified a TER, then it defaults to the TR.

When assuming a gamma function shape to the HRF (ie, -gammafit), there
will be one regressor per condition (Na=1).

When assuming an SPM HRF function shape to the HRF (ie, -spmhrf Nd), then
Na = Nd+1 (Nd is the number of temporal derivatives).

Here's what each of the frames means:
    1 to   Na : always 0
 Na+1 to 2*Na : all frames are the same and equal to the residual stddev
2Na+1 to 3*Na : regression coefficients for condition 1
4Na+1 to 5*Na : stddev of coefficients for condition 1
5Na+1 to 6*Na : regression coefficients for condition 2
6Na+1 to 7*Na : stddev of coefficients for condition 2
...

The stddev of a coefficient is computed first by computing the matrix
M = inv(X'*X) * resvar, where X is the design matrix and resvar is the
residual variance. M is the covariance of the regression coefficients. 
d = diag(M) is a vector of the variances of the regression
coefficient. The stddev is the sqrare root of this.
