% Design and contrast matrices for a One-way Repeated Measures
% ANOVA with one group of Ns subjects and Nr replicants.
%
% By default, it is assumed that the data are arranged in y such that
% the first Nr rows are the replicants of subject 1, the next Nr rows
% are the replicants of subject 2, etc, ie, the replicant is
% "fastest". If SubjFastest=1, the subject is assumed to be fastest,
% ie, the first Ns rows are the first replicant of all subjects, the
% next Ns rows are the second replicant of all subjects, etc.
% The subject means are modeled in the first Ns columns; the next
% Nr-1 model the differences between the first and subsequent
% repeates. This column is scaled to (Nr-1)/Nr so that the expected
% value of the contrast equals the expected value of the simple 
% differences.
%
% Note: When Nr=1, this reduces to an unsigned paired t.
%
% X is the (Ns*Nr)-by-(Ns+Nr-1) design matrix
% C is the (Nr-1)-by-(Ns+Nr-1) contrast matrix
%
%    [beta, rvar, vdof, r] = fast_glmfit(y,X);
%    [F, Fsig, con] = fast_fratio(beta,X,rvar,C);
