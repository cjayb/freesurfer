The TetGen code is Tetrahedral Mesh Generator and Three-Dimensional 
Delaunay Triangulator that compiles to both a libary and a binary.
The code originates from http://tetgen.berlios.de/index.html.

The files taken from this site include:

  tetgen.cxx tetgen.h
  predicates.cxx
  example.poly
  README
  LICENSE

and the following files were created to fit into the Freesurfer code-base:

  Makefile.am - automake input file that creates a Makefile that builds 
                both the library and the binary, and runs a simple test
  test_tetgen - simple test program to run tetgen using the example.poly file
                as input, and compares against prior created output
  test_example.1.* - copied from example.1.* created once by running 
                     tetgen example.poly.  this is the 'known-good output'
