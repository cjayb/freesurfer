This is a bunch of tests for the GPU version of the code, based on the 'tm' system written by Robert McLay at TACC
I've not checked 'tm' itself (which in turn depends on his tweaked version of lua) into the repository, so this won't work by default.

The simplest usage is just to type 'tm .' in this directory
