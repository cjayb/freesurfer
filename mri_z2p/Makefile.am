# When you want to create your program to test, use the following 
# framework:
# You can have as many programs (separated by space) in check_PROGRAMS.
# Your program can consist of many sources (you add to _SOURCES= line).
# You can do "make myown" to compile. The default CFLAGS="-g -O2", but
# you can do "make CFLAGS=-g myown" to create a debugging version.
#
# The program listed as check_PROGRAMS are not compiled under standard 
# "make". Only "make check" will compile them.
# 
# Please don't remove myown.c from this dummy directory.
