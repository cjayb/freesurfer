= Tools =

There are a few mouse commands that work no matter what tool is selected.

You can control-left click to zoom in and recenter, control-right click to zoom out and recenter, and control-middle click to recenter. Recentering is down around the point you click.

Shift-left button and dragging will change the brightness and contrast as you move the mouse around for the current layer (select the current layer in the Layers panel).

== Navigation tool ==

Use this tool to change the viewing state.

Click and drag with the left button to pan the view around. Click and drag with the second button to change the in-plane, moving through the volume. Click and drag with the right button to change the zoom level.

== View Plane tool ==

Use this tool when you are in a multiple view mode to change the viewing plane of a different view. You will see colored boxes around each view, and in other views that those view intersect, you will see straight lines of the same color, representing the intersection plane of that view.

Click on an intersection line and drag with the left button to drag the plane around. You can use this to change the in-plane location and center of the view. Click and drag with the middle button to change the angle of the plane.

== Marker tool ==

Use this tool to create and delete markers. The number of markers allowed is in the Tools panel. When you create a marker that exceeds the number of markers allowed, the first one created will be deleted.

Click with the middle button to create a marker in the clicked position. Click on a marker with the right button to delete that marker.

== Edit Voxels tool ==

This tool allows you to edit voxels in volumes. See the [:ScubaGuide/ScubaWorkingWithData/ScubaAnatomicalVolumes: ScubaAnatomicalVolumes] section for more details.

== Fill Voxels tool ==

attachment:icon_fill_volume.gif

This tool allows you to fill regions of voxels in volumes. See the [:ScubaGuide/ScubaWorkingWithData/ScubaAnatomicalVolumes: ScubaAnatomicalVolumes] section for more details.

== Edit ROIs tool ==

attachment:icon_edit_label.gif

This tool allows you to edit volume ROIs. See the [:ScubaGuide/ScubaWorkingWithData/ScubaAnatomicalVolumes: ScubaAnatomicalROIs] section for more details.

== Fill ROIs tool ==

attachment:icon_fill_roi.gif

This tool allows you to fill regions in volume ROIs. See the [:ScubaGuide/ScubaWorkingWithData/ScubaAnatomicalVolumes: ScubaAnatomicalROIs] section for more details.

== Straight Path tool ==

attachment:icon_line_tool.gif

This tool allows you to draw straight line paths for use as boundaries in filling.

Click with the left button to start a path, and move the mouse to stretch the path out. Click again with the left button to place a vertex in the path and start another segment. Click with the middle mouse button to end the path at the clicked point. Click with the right mouse button to close the path, reconnecting it to the first vertex.

== Edge Path tool ==

attachment:icon_draw_line.gif

This tool is like the Straight Path tool in its commands, but when you stretch the path out, it follows the contours of the volume in the target layer. However, this can be a computationally expensive action, so try to make your path in shorter segments, and slowly.
