/**
 * @file  Path.h
 * @brief A path of Point3 objects
 *
 * This class provides a path made of Point3 objects. The path can be
 * constructed in segments, marking the end of the segment so the
 * current segment can be cleared and filled in as needed. Note: This
 * is not the best designed class (along with PathManager) so try to
 * roll with it.
