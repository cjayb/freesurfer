/**
 * @file  ShortestPathFinder.h
 * @brief Calculates shortest path in 2D
 *
 * This class calculates shortest paths in a 2D plane given a cost to
 * go to each point. An edge bias factor allows difference importance
 * to be placed on the edge cost vs. the distance (1.0 for cardinal
 * points, 1.4 for diagonals). The path from point A to B is returned
 * as A+1 to B, not including the original point A.  To use it,
 * subclass Shortest and redefine GetEdgeCost if you want.
